# Introduction
Low customer satisfaction can have direct and indirect costs (e.g., refunds, customer support, bad word-of-mouth, etc.). Especially with online platforms displaying ratings for sellers or products, these negative online reviews can have long-lasting and outsized effects on the bottom line and brand. 

**[Olist](https://olist.com/pt-br/)** is a rapidly growing Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small merchants to major online regional marketplaces and offers sellers an integrated solution such as fulfillment, customer support, and payment services. 

In this project, I analyze a dataset containing 100k orders from Olist to figure out *how the company can increase customer satisfaction (so as to increase profit margins) while still maintaining a healthy order volume*. This repo contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks documenting my analysis.

# Analysis üìä 

***QUESTION:*** *How do we increase customer satisfaction (so as to increase profit margins) while maintaining a healthy order volume?*

I break this question down into 2 parts:

*1. What factors influence customer satisfaction?*

*2. What impact does adjusting those factors have on profits margins and order volume?*


**PART 1**

To understand more clearly what factors influence customer satisfaction (as measured by review scores), I first perform exploratory data analysis using Python and then examine the characteristics of the data, distributions, and correlations. Next, I run linear regression models to identify which features have the largest impact on customer review scores. To corroborate these findings, I re-frame the analysis so that we can also run logistic regression models on the data.

- [Sellers Data Analysis](https://nbviewer.org/github/phlln/olist-analysis/blob/main/notebooks/Sellers%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb?flush_cache=True)

**PART 2**

My approach is to first look for achievable gains that can be implemented in the short term. Given the findings from Part 1, I  explore the impact of removing ‚Äúpoor-quality sellers‚Äù who have garnered enough bad review scores to negatively impact both profit margins and Olist‚Äôs brand. I conclude with a summary of the findings and my recommendations.
