    "- The *more* sellers (`number_of_sellers`) and products (`number_of_products`) that are combined into a single order, the *lower* the review score.  \n",
    "- The *longer* the `wait_time` for a delivery, the *lower* the review score.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our earlier analysis also found that *orders containing multiple sellers or products do not make up a large portion of orders on the platform* (~10%), so any policy changes (e.g. restricting orders to a single seller) would have a limited impact. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, `wait_time` is made up of two components (seller's `delay_to_carrier` + `carrier_delivery_time`). Our analysis also found that the proportion of sellers who have delayed shipment to a carrier is only about 6%. Moreover, the component `carrier_delivery_time` is less directly in Olist's control and further analysis of their operations or finding new carrier partners is not an easy-fix we'd like to propose to the CEO. \n",
    "\n",
    "It appears that there are other factors contributing to a low review score that are outside of the Orders and Sellers datasets. Rather than searching for and trying to isolate all the factors contributing to low review scores, we'll try a different approach in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our preliminary analysis suggests there are multiple factors driving low review scores, and focusing efforts on improving a single factor may not be sufficient, let's instead use low review scores as a way to filter better performing sellers. By ascribing costs to reviews with low ratings, we'll also be able to calculate how much impact keeping these sellers on the platform will have on the bottom line.    \n",

    "\n",
    "To respond to how Olist can improve customer satisfaction and profit margins while still keeping a healthy order volume, we conducted a review of Olist's Orders and Sellers datasets. From this data, our analysis found that ***long wait times* and single orders with *multiple products or sellers* were associated with lower review scores**. However, our findings also suggest that there are other unaccounted for factors (likely outside of these datasets) that have an impact on low review scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given our limited view of all the factors influencing low review scores, we decided to respond to the issues of  customer satisfaction and profit margins from a different approach. Instead of trying to figure out which individual factors are connected to low review scores, we shifted attention to quantifying the impact on Olist if poor-performing sellers (defined as sellers with enough bad reviews to have a negative profit for Olist) were removed from the platform.    \n",
    "\n",
    "In this alternative approach, we discovered that roughly **9%** of sellers can be classified as **'poor-performing'** because of negative profits to Olist. Additionally, this small group of sellers had **7x** the order volume of other sellers and accounted for **40%** of cumulative IT costs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our conclusions found that removal of 'poor-performing' sellers that can improve overall customer satisfaction, keep a healthy order volume, and boost profits in the short term by **46%** or **580,196 BRL** (110,598 USD).\n"

    "In the short term, we believe that Olist can improve profits and overall customer satisfaction by removing poor-performing sellers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our preliminary analysis shows that removing these sellers from the platform will immediately increase Olist profits by reducing costs on two fronts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Costs Associated with Bad Reviews** - removal of sellers who have received enough bad reviews to have a drag on Olist margins will **boost profits by 20%** amounting to an increase of **313,277 BRL** (58,246 USD).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **IT Costs** - IT costs are a function of overall order volume, and since poor-performing sellers have been found to have a disproportionately large order volume, their removal translates into an overall **40% reduction in IT costs** amounting to a savings of **266,919 BRL** (~50,868 USD). \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, by removing poor-performing sellers from the platform, Olist stands to see an immediate gain of **580,196 BRL** (~110,484 USD) or increase of **46%** to its financial performance. Additionally, we would expect to see an overall improvement in brand reputation as average customer satisfaction increases."
